# Global Health Data Analytics Dashboard

This web-based interactive dashboard provides data visualizations and insights for exploring and analyzing global health and demographic data. Users can interact with various charts to understand trends in mortality rates, prevalence rates, and risk factors across countries and regions over time.

## Features

The dashboard contains 4 pages which different features

Overview Page

- \*\*Global Heart Disease Analytics Overview: Interactive summary of key statistics, including total countries analyzed, most recent year of data, and average mortality and prevalence rates.
  Key Metrics & Insights
- \*\*Total Countries Analyzed: Displays the number of countries and territories with heart disease data.
  Most Recent Year of Data: Shows the latest year for which data is available.
- \*\*Average Mortality Rate: Presents the average heart disease mortality rate (per 100,000 people).
- \*\*Average Prevalence Rate: Displays the average heart disease prevalence rate (per 100,000 people).
- **Top 8 Countries by Metric: View the top 8 countries based on selected metrics such as Prevalence Rate, - **Mortality Rate, and Incidence Rate. Allows filtering by year for more granular analysis.
- \*\*Global GDP & Health Expenditure Trend: Visualize trends for GDP and health expenditure as a percentage of GDP over time.
- \*\*Life Expectancy & Health Expenditure Trends: Compare trends in life expectancy and health expenditure (% of GDP) over time.
- \*\*Risk Factor Analysis
- \*\*Global Risk Factors (Latest Year): Displays key risk factors such as Obesity Prevalence Rate, Physical Activity Rate, Alcohol Consumption, and Diabetes Prevalence Rate for the most recent year.
  Health Expenditure & Risk Factor Trends: Explore correlations between health expenditure and major risk factors, like obesity and physical inactivity, across different countries.
- \*\*Data Sources: A comprehensive list of authoritative global health and economic databases used in the analysis, including sources like WHO Global Health Observatory, World Bank, and Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study.

Global Health Maps

- \*\*Interactive Visualizations: Explore a wide range of interactive charts, including choropleth maps, bar plots, and scatter plots to analyze global health data.

## Installation
To run the deployed app: https://glass-timing-450808-q8.uc.r.appspot.com/

To run this app locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NicoleNBruce/Global-Heart-Disease-Visualisation-Project_Team1.git
cd Global-Heart-Disease-Visualisation-Project_Team1
```
````

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

It’s recommended to use a virtual environment for Python projects:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Mac OS

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the App

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the app:

```bash
python main_dashboard.py
```

The app will be running on your local machine at `http://127.0.0.1:8050/`. Open this URL in your browser to access the dashboard.
